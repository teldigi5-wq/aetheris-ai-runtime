# Runtime strict signed revocation facts — draft-only, NO_GO

The isolated Runtime pinned RS256 verifier now exposes an explicit
`verifyBearerForRevocation` entry: it first checks the real RSA signature,
operator-pinned kid, exact issuer and audience, signed UID, role/scope
and time window. It then fails closed if the genuine signed JWT has no
bounded `jti` (16–128 safe printable characters). A sealed
`VerifiedRevocationFacts` type privately retains the signed UID, issuer,
key ID, token ID and issue time. Reading these facts after token expiry
fails closed, even if the Java principal object was retained.

This is **not** a live B62 revocation adapter or an allow decision.
The preexisting `verifyBearer` path remains unchanged for already tested
synthetic task/mission/JDBC containment; callers cannot infer that it
performs session revocation. A future production authorization path must
FIRST obtain revocation-bound signed facts and THEN consult an independently
authenticated, primary-consistent read-only B62 store, deny stale/failed
readers, enforce signer blocks and the principal epoch, and separately
enforce tenant/object ownership. The current filters still quarantine
all uncertified /api, /actuator, task, mission and SSE requests.

An actual-RSA JUnit test verifies missing signed jti denial, correct
signed provenance for an independently minted UUIDv4 token, and denial
of retained provenance after the trusted clock advances beyond expiry.
The mandatory exact-head security CI covers this with the existing real
PostgreSQL16, direct HTTP, route inventory and cleanup matrix.

Runtime issue #23 and Platform issue #251 remain OPEN; protected main
and W5-L stay unchanged; Stage45 and all nine production attestations NO_GO.
No live token exchange, production session revocation, migration, customer
HTTP API, deployment or model execution is authorized.
